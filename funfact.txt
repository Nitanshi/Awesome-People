Pringles - their defining quality is the saddle shape, which is known in 
official terms as a hyperbolic paraboloid  isn't just for aesthetics,
it also makes it easier to stack the chips in the cylindrical tube container,
as the hyperbolic paraboloid is plotted over a circular domain.
Another advantage of this shape is that it minimizes the possibility of 
broken chips during transport, since they're all packed together so tightly.
